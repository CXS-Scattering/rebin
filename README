The short rebin function resamples a 1D histogram to new bins.

Say you have an array x1 of bin edges (m+1 entries), and counts in each one are
recorded in array y1 (m entries). Instead of having the data in the x1 bins,
you have another set of bins that you want the data sorted into.  This new set
of bins is represented by x2 (with n+1 entries). The rebin function
redistributes the counts in y1 into a new array y2 (n entries). 

To do this rebinning, the counts in each x1 bin are assumed to be uniformly
distributed within that bin.

The function works with array-like objects as determined by Numpy.

Uncertainties in y1 can be propagated through rebin if y1 is a uarray from the
Python uncertainties module.
